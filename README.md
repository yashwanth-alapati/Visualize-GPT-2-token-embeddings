NOTE: I'm working on writing proper documentation for the project and the tech-stack as well.

Gist of what the project is about:

We have used Nomic API to create visualization of GPT-2 token embeddings.We intend to run the same pipeline on BERT,Llama and other LLM to dissect and look inside the LLMs, also generate comparsions.
